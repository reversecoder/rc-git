Troubleshooting

* Safe checkout mode


   <<rc-git>> attempts to reuse as much as possible the same temp directory as for a given remote git repository. It could be possible that this represents a problem. It could be a good idea to perform a test deploy through the command:
   
+--  
mvn clean deploy site-deploy -DperformRelease -Drc.git.safe.checkout=true
+--

* Debug mode


   It is possible to print some debug messages through the environment property <<<rc.git.debug>>>. It could be a good idea for error reporting to use:
   
+--
mvn clean deploy site-deploy -DperformRelease -Drc.git.debug=true
+--
